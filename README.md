# translation

Purpose: Automating translation training questions and content for non-english clients

Google sheets had a translation formula but the output was not consistent with the results you get from Google translate via web view

In this script we call the Google Cloud Translate API to automate the translation of training questions (and potentially content)

Created to support Melar (Turkish) but will find this potentially useful for future clients who will not require english bots
